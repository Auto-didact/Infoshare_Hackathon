The project has five basic apps:

* News (A Twitter-like microblog)
* Articles (A collaborative blog or a Facebook like post)
* Question & Answers (A Stack Overflow-like platform)
* Messeger (A basic chat-a-like tool for asynchronous communication.)
* Groups (which could be a club or event: Coding Club, Alcheringa)
